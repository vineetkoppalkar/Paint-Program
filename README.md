# Paint-Program
This is a painting program made using Java swing that has a movable canvas and color palette. The canvas is used to draw upon by selecting a color from the color palette. The color pallete contains 22 colors, an adjustable brush size slider, an eraser and a clear canvas button. 

## Objective
The objective of this personal project was to become more familiar with Java swing as well as Graphics2D which allows the user to draw on the canvas.

## Why is it called "Holi"?
I wanted to give a unique name to this painting program. Holi is known as the festival of colors in India (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holi) and I thought it would be an interesting name for a paint program with bright colors.
